# What is JAX/Flax?

JAX is a computational library similar to TensorFlow 2 (tf2) and PyTorch, providing powerful operations for numerical computations and automatic differentiation. Flax, built on top of JAX, is analogous to torch.nn in PyTorch and Keras in TensorFlow, offering a high-level interface for neural network design and training.
